  Elegant boy, beautiful girl |
  Dancing for joy, delicate whirl |

  Two lovers dance face to face with undulating grace |
  They gently sway then slip away to some secluded place |
  Shades of delight cocoa hue |
  Rich as the night, afro blue |
  Dream of a land my soul is from |

  What's it all about |
  Alfie |
  Is it just for the moment we live
  What's it all about
  When you sort it out
  Alfie
  Are we meant to take more than we give
  Or are we meant to be kind
  And if only fools are kind
  Alfie
  Then I guess
  It is wise to be cruel
  And if life belongs
  Only to the strong
  Alfie
  What will you lend on
  An old golden rule
  As sure as I believe
  There's a heaven above
  Alfie
  I know there's something much more
  Something even non-believers
  Can believe in
  I believe in love
  Alfie
  Without true love you just exist
  Alfie
  Until you find the love you've missed
  You're nothing
  Alfie
  When you walk let your heart lead the way
  And you'll find love any day

  Alice | in | Wonder- | land |
How do you get to Wonderland?
Over the hill or under land?
Or just behind the tree?

When clouds go rolling by
They roll away and leave the sky
Where is the land beyond the eye
That people cannot see

And where do stars go?
Where is the crescent moon?
They must be somewhere
In the sunny afternoon

Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland?
Over the hill or here or there?
I really wonder where?

And where do stars go?
Where is the crescent moon?
They must be somewhere
In the sunny afternoon

Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland?
Over the hill or here or there?
I really wonder where?

Say where do stars go?
Where is the crescent moon?
They must be somewhere
In the crazy afternoon

Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland?
Over the hill or here or there?
I wonder where?

Tell me where
Where is that faraway land
That the eye can't see
Show me the way to Wonderland

The sea, the sky, the you and I
The sea, the sky, for you and I
I'll know we're all blues
All Shades, all hues, all blues
Some blues are sad
But some are glad,
Dark-sad or bright-gald
They're all blues
All shades, all hues, all blues
The color of colors
The blues are more than a color
They're a moan of pain
A Taste of strife
And a sad refrain
A game which lif is pplayin'
Blues can be the livin' dues
We're all a-payin'
Yeah, Oh Lord
In a rainbow
A summer day that's fair
A parayer is prayed
A lament that's made
Some shade of blues is there;
Blue heaven's hue,
They're all blues
Talkin' 'bout the sea and the sky
Andi'm talkin' 'bout you and I
The sea, the sky
For you and I
And I know we're all blues
All shades,
All hues,
All blues
Sea, sky, you and I
See the sky, you and I
All Blues
All shades, all hues, all blues

Lyrics
{
Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel
They're making me feel I'm home
It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love 
Autumn in New York is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

  / The falling | leaves | / drift by my | window |
  / The falling | leaves | / of red and | gold |

  / I see your | lips | / the summer | kisses |
  / The sunburned | hands | / I used to | hold |

  // Since you | went ~ away | / the days grow | long |
  / And soon I'll | hear | / old winter's | song |
  // But I | miss you most of | all / my | darling |
  // When | autumn | leaves start to | fall |

She's a fool and | don't I know it? |
But a fool can | have her charms |
I'm in love and | don't I show it? |
Like a babe in | arms |

Love's the same old | sad sensation |
Lately, I've | not slept a wink |
Since this silly | situation |
Has me on the | blink |


I'm wild again | beguiled again |
A simpering, whimpering | child again |
Bewitched, bothered and | bewildered am | I | |

Couldn't sleep | wouldn't sleep |
Then love came and told me | I shouldn't sleep |
Bewitched, bothered and | bewildered am | I | |

Lost my heart | but what of it? |
She is cold | I agree |
She might laugh | but I love it 
Although the | laugh's on | me |

I'll sing to her | bring spring to her |
And long for the day | when I'll cling to her |
Bewitched, bothered and | bewildered am | I |

Lyrics
{
  I'm feeling mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room
I'm talking to the shadows
One o'clock to four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dream's too dry
Now, a man is born to go a-loving
A woman's born to weep and fret
And stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes
I'm moody all the morning
Mourning all the night
And in between, it's nicotine
And not much hard to fight
Coffee
Feeling low as the ground
It's driving me crazy
This waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

If, you were on my mind, all night and day, blame it on my youth

Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

It's a good thing or it's bad

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all
Love is tearful, or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful I know

When the wintry winds start blowing
And the snow is starting to fall
Then my eyes turn westward knowing
That's the place that I love best of all
California, I've been blue
Since I've been away from you.
I can't wait till I get going
Even now I'm starting in a call
California, here I come
Right back where I started from
Where bowers are flowers bloom in the spring
Each morning at dawning
Birdies sing and everything
A sun kissed miss said "Don't be late!"
That's why I can hardly wait,
Open up that Golden Gate! 
California, here I come!
California, here I come, yeah!
Right where I started from
Where bowers are flowers bloom in the spring
Each morning at dawning
Birdies sing and everything
A sun kissed miss said "Don't be late!"
That's why I can hardly wait
Open up, open up, open up that Golden Gate!

You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that is real
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off You
I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby

I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart

  Night and stars above that shine so bright
The mystery of their fading light

Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep
Across the sands so I may keep
The memory of our Caravan
This is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms
You beside me here beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert Caravan
This is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms
Night and stars above that shine so bright

No more blues, I'm going back home
No, no more blues, I promise no more to roam
Home is where the heart is
The funny part is my heart's been right there all along
No more tears and no more sighs
And no more fears, I'll say no more goodbyes
If travel beckons me, I swear I'm gonna refuse
I'm gonna settle down and there'll be no more blues
Everyday while I am far away
My thoughts turn homeward, forever homeward
I've traveled 'round the world in search of happiness
But all the happiness I've found was in my hometown
No more blues, I'm going back home
No, no more dues, I'm through with all my wandering now
I'll settle down and never roam and find a man and build a home
When we settle down, there'll be no more blues
Nothing but happiness when we settle down, there'll be no more blues
Everyday while I am far away
My thoughts turn homeward, forever homeward
I've traveled 'round the world in search of happiness
But all the happiness I've found was in my hometown
No more blues, I am going back home
No, no, no more dues, I'm through with all my wandering now
I'll settle down and never roam and find a man and build me a home

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways

If | you can use some | exotic booze

Come | fly with me, we'll | fly, we'll fly | away | //

Come | fly with me, will | float down to | Peru | //
In | llama-land there's a | one-man band
And he'll | toot his flute for | you
Come | fly with me, we'll | float down in the | blue |

Once I get you | up there |
Where the air is | rarefied | |
We'll just | glide |
Starry-eyed |

Once I get you | up there |
I'll be holding | you so near |
You might | hear /
All the | angels cheer | because we're together |

Weather-wise | it's such a lovely | day | //
Just | say those words and | we'll feed those birds
Down to | Acapulco | Bay
It is | perfect for a | flying honeymoon | they | say /
Come | fly with me, we'll | fly, we'll fly | away |

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
'Cause I cried, I cried, I cried a river over you
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said?
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and
And now you say, you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river

Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!
But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit sky
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream
Darn that one track mind of mine
It can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare
Darn that dream
And bless it too
Without that dream I never have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true

The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through the meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before
The lone-ly night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
The days of wine and roses
[more instrumental-rest of the first verse]
The lonely - the night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There is nothing in life but you
I never regret the things that I'm giving
They're easy to give when you're in love
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you
For you maybe I'm a fool
But it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, it's grand
They just don't understand
Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you
For you maybe I'm a fool
But it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Baby, it's grand
They just don't understand
Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me
I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want these arms about you
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa, come to papa do

Above all, I want my arms about you
So don't you be, a naughty baby

Every time we say goodbye
I die a little
Every time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little
Why the Gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go
When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye

Lyrics
{
Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains
Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an "Airmail Special" too
Your answer was "Goodbye"
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me

Know why I've been blue

For someone exactly like you
Why should I spend some money
On a show or two
When nobody sings these love songs
Exactly like you
You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
You make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming
Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you
You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
Baby you make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming
Now I know why my mama

Yes she knew just around the corner

Lyrics
{
I weave with brightly colored strings
To keep my mind off other things
So, ladies, let your fingers
dance
And keep your hands out of romance
Lovely witches
Let the stitches
Keep your fingers under
control
Cut the thread, but leave
The whole heart whole
Merry maids can sew and sleep
Wives can only
sew and weep
Falling in love with love
Is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love
Is
playing the fool
Caring too much is juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just
For children in school
I
fell in love with love one night
When the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes
Unable to see
I fell
in love with love
With love everlasting
But love fell out with me

  Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever (you give me fever) when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight (you give me fever)
Fever in the mornin'
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right
You give me fever (You give me fever) when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight (You give me fever)
Fever in the mornin'
Fever all through the night (Wow!)
Everybody's got the fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long time ago
Baby, turn on your love light (Yeah, yeah)
Let it shine on me (Yeah, yeah)
Well, baby, turn on your love light (Yeah, yeah)
And let it shine on me (Yeah, yeah)
Well, just a little bit higher (Yeah, yeah)
And just a little bit brighter, baby (Yeah, yeah)
Ow!
You give me fever (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You give me fever (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You give me fever (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You give me fever
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, "Julie baby you're my flame"
Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn forsooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said "Daddy oh don't you dare"
"He gives me fever with his kisses"
"Fever when he holds me tight"
"Fever, I'm his missus"
"Daddy won't you treat him right?"
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
We give you fever when we kiss you
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

Light as a thistle
Quick, quick as a wink

To see that tears never fall
This this little penny 
Is the last little penny 
Most important of all 
For this penny is to love on
And where love is, heaven is there

Fill my heart with song and let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

A foggy day
In London town
Well, it had me low
And it had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had
Somehow lost its charm
How long, I wondered
Could this thing last?
But the age of miracles 
Well, it hadn't past
For suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

Lyrics
{
Of the wonderful things that you get out of life there are four.
And they may not be many but nobody needs any more.
Of the many facts making the list of life,
Truth takes the lead.
And to relax knowing the gist of life,
it's truth you need.
Then the second is honor and happiness makes number three.
When you put them together you know what the last one must be.
Baby so truth, honor and happiness
and one thing more,
meaning only wonderful, wonderful love that'll make four.

Lyrics
{
Take a seat and cool it 'cause unless you overrule it
We are ready to show you some blowin'
A rompin' and a stompin' is a lot of fun
Four brothers who are blowin' our horns

So settle down an' listen 'cause you don't know what you're missin'
And we're ready to give you a showin'
A movin' it 'n groovin' it has just begun
Four brothers who are blowin' our horns

We got a little message that you're gonna enjoy
Ain't no sense in dodgin' the facts
So settle in your easy chair an' if you ever had a care - forget it,
It's time to relax

We might as well admit it, we're the best that ever did it
But in case you ain't too sure a knowin'
We're gonna let you listen to us one by one
Four brothers who are blowin' our horns

How'd ya do, I'm talkin' about you
It's very nice to know that you have really taken time to listen to me blow
'Cause as sure as I'm born, I'm blowin' my horn
It's me baby, I'm blowin', zootin' it up
And I hope you dig the sounds I'm makin' more'n any other
Now I must go for it's time for you to listen to my other brother

I think the chick's talkin' 'bout me so I'd better go 'n see
I'm hip that she knows a horn is very best to greet you
That's the reason I'm blowin' so snappily
I don't know what ya got, but it thrills me an' I hope to have a lot
'Cause it puts me in clover
So baby, if you would like to dig my other brother
You're gonna have to turn the record over

Hey hey hey
Who ya talkin' about, say who ya talkin' about
Did I hear you say you'd introduce your other brother
'Cause in case I heard you talkin' about three, that's me
Pleased to meet you, how'd you do, how are you, nothing new,
How is everything with you?
Whattya say I leave this jazz up to my brother --

Dig dig dig my Long Island sound
I hope you're puttin' it down
You got me in a mood that's so romantic
If you notice you can dig this silly old act
Because I'm actin' so distracted when I dig you
Pretty baby you will never know how much I really dig you
You have got me so excited that I goofed blowin' my horn

Ooh bop the news is gettin' around, we're really puttin' it down
We're glad of fact that you enjoy it and we wish we had the time to give you more
Thank you for the compliment
You told us we were better just as if we didn't know it
We're hip that we're the best, we're over all the rest
We're in the modern school, we always play it cool, we never play the fool
The honkers and the squeakers might be stealin' the show
But we don't go for that, so while we blow

Hi-ho, lackadaise, for it's a natural fact
I ain't no kin, but I would like to get in the act!

Well get outta here, get outta here, get outta here
Now fellas we appreciate him makin you mad,
But we must ask you to apologize
Because after all he's in our band

Four brothers, four brothers, four brothers
Although we sound like more
Four brothers, four brothers, four brothers
We're really only four

We like to blow but we don't know how time can fly and how our cares pass away
We wish the time would never go so we could take our time an' blow 'til judgement day

Four brothers, four brothers, four brothers
Now just one final word:

I'd like to know you and I hope I don't forget you
It's really a pleasure and I hope I don't look silly to you
I'm hopin' the story that I told did not upset you
Sorry now in conclusion were you hoping that you heard four

So just before we go we want you to know ---
We're glad you let us show you how we always end up with that jazz
(We don't call for back up on the road)
Oh - ohhh!!!!

I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And "I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!"
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming

  Olha que coisa mais | linda Mais cheia de |
  graça É ela | menina Que vem e que | passa No | doce balanço | a caminho do mar | |

  Moça do corpo | dourado Do sol de | Ipanema O seu balançado | é mais que um |
  poema É a coisa mais | linda que | eu já vi passar | |

  Oh, | porque estou tão | sozinho | |
  Oh, | porque tudo é tão | triste | |
  Oh, | a beleza que | existe | |
  A beleza que não é só | minha |
  Que também passa | sozinha |

  Ah, se ela | soubesse Que quando ela | passa O mundo | inteirinho se enche de |
  graça E fica | mais lindo Por | causa do amor | |



/*
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah
But he watch her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he
Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, he smile - but she doesn't see

Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible said and it still is news
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding round the door
When you're gone, spending ends
They don't come no more
Rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own
He just worry 'bout nothin'
Cause he's got his own

Gone With the Wind
Just like a leaf that has flown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has blown away
Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips,
I've had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips.

But now all-all is gone.
Gone is the rapture that fills my heart
Gone with the Wind
My romance has flown apart

Just like a flame
Love burned brightly, then became
An empty smoke ring that has gone,
Gone with the Wind.

Gone, gone, gone with the wind
Just like a leaf that has flown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown away
Yesterday's kisses are still, still on my lips,
I've had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips.

But now all-all is gone.
Gone is the rapture that fills my heart
Gone with the Wind
My romance has flown apart

Just like a flame
Love burned brightly, then became
An empty smoke ring that has
Gone with the Wind.

Talk about the moon floatin' in the sky
Lookin' at a lily on the lake
Talk about a bird learnin' how to fly
Makin' all the music he can make
Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk
Talk about things you'd like to do
You got to have a dream, if you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?

Talk about a boy sayin' to a girl
"Golly, baby, I'm a lucky 'cause"
Talk about the girl sayin' to the boy
"You and me is lucky to be us"
Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk
Talk about things you'd like to do
You got to have a dream, if you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?
If you don't talk happy and you never have dream
Then you'll never have a dream come true

Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way
Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

  I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
How deep is your love?

Lyrics
{
As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.
So my dear I swore,
"Never, never more!"
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my, how I lost out!
I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?
There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
how long has this been going on?
Oh, I feel that I could melt;
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.
Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!
Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going, on?

The North Pole I have charted, but I can't get
Started with you
Around the golf course I'm under par
And all the movies want me to star
I've got a house, a show place, but I get no
Place with you
You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you
Scheme, just for a sight of you
Dream, both day and night of you
And what good does it do?
In 1929 I sold short
In England I'm presented at court
But you've got me downhearted, cause I can't get
Started with you
You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you
Scheme, just for a sight of you
Dream, both day and night of you
And what good does it do?

Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.
Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.
I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.
Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find
Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.
Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.
Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.
You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.
Please don't be blue for the present, 
When it's so pleasant to hear you say
I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.
Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find
Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.
Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Whenever skies look grey to me
And trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds
Begin to blow
I concentrate on you
When fortune cries nay, nay to me
And people declare "you're through"
Whenever the blues becomes my only song
I concentrate on you
On your smile to sweet so tender
When first my kiss you deny
On the love in your eyes
When you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine
And so when wise men say to me
That loves young dreams never come true
To prove that even wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on you.

Lyrics

Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps
Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive
I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too
I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand
Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, "I'm all your own"
I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now
Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, "I'm all your own"
I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly

And "I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!"
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two

My baby ever treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;
I got it bad and that ain't good!
My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good!
Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
And the things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
Tho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him
Lord above me make him love me the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!

No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day

No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart,
of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart,
baby of my heart

I know he'll never be forgotten
He was a king uncrowned
I know I'll always remember
The warmth of his sound
Lingering long I'm sure he's still around
For those who heard they respect him yet
So those who hear won't forget
The sound of each phrase
Echoing time uncountable by days
The things he played are with us now
And they'll endure should time allow
Oh yes I remember Clifford
I seem to always fed him near somehow
Every day I hear his lovely tone
In every trumpet sound that has a beauty all its own
So how can we say something so real has really gone away?
I hear him now, I always will
Believe me I remember Clifford still.

Heaven sends 
A song through its doors 
Just as if it seems to know 
I'm exclusively yours 
Knowing this 
I feel but one way 
You will understand too 
In these words that I say 
I'll close my eyes 
To everyone but you 
And when I do 
I'll see you standing there 
Mmh, I'll lock my heart 
To any other caress 
I'll never say yes 
To a new love affair 
I'll close my eyes 
To everything that's gay 
If you're not there 
To share each lovely day 
And through the years 
Those moments 
When we're far apart 
I close my eyes 
Mmh, and see you with my heart
I'll close my eyes
To everything that's gay 
But if you're not there 
To share each lovely day 
And through the years 
Those moments 
When we're far apart 
I'll close my eyes 
Oh, and see you with my heart

This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad
I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm, and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you
The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget, but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile

I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light

Funny, but when you're near me

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!
If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

Oh won't you stay old fashioned with me
Oh please stay old fashioned with me

I've got you under my skin
I have got you, deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I'd tried so, not to give in
And I said to myself this affair it never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well 
That I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night 
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know, you fool
You never can win 
Use your mentality 
Wake up to reality 
And each time I do just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin 
'Cause I've got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice comes in the night 
And repeats how it yells in my ear
Don't you know, you fool
That ain't no just win 
Why not use your mentality
Wake up, step up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you 
Makes me stop just before I begin 
Because I've got you under my skin
Yea, you grab me under my skin

If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the skies
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die
The birds in May time
Would sing a lonely refrain
And I would wander around
Hating the sound of rain
With you beside me
No wind in winter would blow
With you beside me
A rose would bloom in the snow
I gave you my love
But I was living a dream
And living would seem in vain
If I lost you

Lyrics

Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're cosy and clingin'
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a bell, I'd be ringin'
From the moment we kissed tonight
That's the way I've just gotta behave
Boy, if I were a lamp, I'd light
Or if I were a banner, I'd wave
Ask me how do I feel
Little me with my quiet upbringing
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a gate, I'd be swinging
And if I were a watch
I'd start popping my springs
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding
Yes, I knew my morale would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked
Boy, if I were a duck, I'd quack
Or if I were a goose, I'd be cooked
Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're fondly caressing
Well, if I were a salad
I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
Or if I were a gate, I would swing
Have a fling almost any old thing
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding, ding dong

Lyrics
{
Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
"What to do, what to do?"

Have you ever felt
A gentle touch and then a kiss
And then and then and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again?
Oh, well

Imagination is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine
That you want me, too

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude 
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly

Why haven't you seen it

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking

You're the ghost of a romance in June going astray

Lyrics
{
You and your smile
Hold a strange invitation
Somehow it seems
We've shared our dreams
But where?

Time after time
In a room full of strangers
Out of the blue
Suddenly you are there

Wherever I go
You're the glow of temptation
Glancing my way
In the gray of the dawn

And always your eyes
Smile that strange invitation
When you are gone
Where oh, where have you gone?

How long must I stay
In a world of illusion?
Be where you are
So near yet so far apart

Hoping you'll say
With a warm invitation
Where have you been?
Darling, come in into my heart
Wherever I go
You're the glow of temptation
Glancing my way
In the gray of the dawn

And always your eyes
Smile that strange invitation
When you are gone
Where oh, where have you gone?

How long must I stay
In a world of illusion?
Be where you are
So near yet so far apart

Hoping you'll say
With a warm invitation
Where have you been?
Darling, come in into my heart

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard
Isn't it romantic?
Moving shadows write the oldest magic word
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love
Isn't it romantic?
Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss
Sweet symbols in the moonlight
Do you mean that I will fall in love perchance?
Isn't it romance?
Sweet symbols in the moonlight
Do you mean that I will fall in love perchance?
Isn't it romantic?
Isn't it romance?

Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love

Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love

Isn't she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love

Run when church bells ring.

I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring
I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?
I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring
It might as well be spring

It's the wrong time, and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not his face, but such a charming face
That it's all right with me
It's the wrong song, in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not his smile, but such a lovely smile
That it's all right with me
You can't know how happy I am that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?
It's the wrong game, with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not his lips, but they're such tempting lips
That, if some night, you are free
Dear, it's all right, yes, it's all right with me
You can't know how happy I am that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?
It's the wrong game, with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not his lips, but they're such tempting lips

How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last?

Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one
Please, don't say no to my plea

There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you

Last time
Last time I saw Jeannine
She looked just like a royal queen
And she cruised by
With some wealthy guy
In a Cadillac limousine
Last time
Last time I saw Jeannine
Last time 
Last time I saw Jeannine
Recall when we were seventeen
I was a beau
'Twas not so long ago
But too short
Of that long lost dream
To satisfy Jeannine
Now she's gone from me
Moved away from the old neighborhood
And I'm certain
She's gone for good
Last time
Last time I saw Jeannine
The dollar signs stood in between
It was a love lost to the rising cost
But since then, I have never seen
I have never seen Jeannine
Now she's gone from me
Moved away from the old neighborhood
And I'm certain
She's gone for good
Last time
Last time I saw Jeannine
The dollar signs stood in between
It was a love lost to the rising cost
But since then, I have never seen
I have never seen Jeannine
Last time
Last time I saw Jeannine
Last time

Hey cats - are you ready
Oh Jeannine (Jeannine)

The joy spring, the fountain of pleasure
Is deep inside you whether you're diggin' it or not
Once you're aware of this spring
You'll know that it's the greatest 
Treasure you've got
And furthermore
The joy spring, the bounteous treasure
Cannot be bartered away and never
Can be sold
Nothing can take it from you
It's yours and yours alone to have
And to hold
And something more:
It never is lost to fire or theft
It's always around
When trouble is gone the pleasure
Is left I've always found
It's burglar-proof same as the treasure
Man lays up in heaven worth a
Price no one can measure
That says a lot
So joy spring this fountain of pleasure
That's deep inside you let me inform
You in all truth *(to Coda second time)
Ponce de Leon sought this
When he was searchin' for the fountain of youth
Ol' Ponce de Leon laughed so much he 
Never did find the magic fountain
But many people with a well-adjusted
Spirit they could hear it when why'told
'em it was there tellin' them was
Like tellin' it on the mountain
It's quite a life havin' the gift of 
Laughter I'm a man who knows in a
Minute I can tell why'just exactly how the story goes
It involves a firm conviction in another 
Previous life givin' your mind a chance to fly
Fly aroun' the universe investigatin' other
Galaxies n' certain other subtle
Types o'life tryin' t'dig it gettin'
Pretty well-acquainted with a lot of
Other strife an' pretty much acquirin'
Yourself plenty of education
Pretty soon here comes earth birth
'n then why'ready t'put it all t'work
But soon as you're finished bein' born
You start forgettin' what you knew
'Cause you're another kinda you - a
Reincarnation manifestation
Of spirit in sensation
why'really got that right
The average person isn't bright
Not so bright that they recall the fatal fall
Down here t' this earth
Their minds disguise their death to spirit
Life and call it birth
That's their reason for forgetting and they 
Find it very upsetting when reminded 
Tell 'em they've lived before
They'll show why' the nearest open door
Gotta have feelin' while dealin' with
Walkers in their sleep
They can't imagine somethin' as deep
Here they come - here they come - there they are
Unimaginative and ignorant of falling from a star
Here they come - there they are - there they go
Life is over in a minute an' they never dug
It in it or enjoy a minute of it
'cause they put too much above it
That was gross
Somethin' that was worth a couple bucks
At mos'
So there is the reason that the maker of man
Included there in his plan
A certain fountain deep within'
Where there was laughter, youth 'n gold
For human beings t'have 'n hold
'n share the memory of where we've all been
Brothers called Grimm knew chances were slim'
Anybody would dig that the human soul 
Was Snow White
And the Seven Dwarfs were seven tempers 
In man 
Whose digging out the gold completes 
The plan
An Bacon was hip that Shakespeare 
Couldn't read
And so he gave him all the rhymes
That have lasted through the years
And kept eternal truths alive through
Several centuries
That's how we know them now 
They lasted 'cause they're true
What was it from "MacBeth?"
"Life's but a walking shadow
A player poor
That struts and frets upon the stage
And's seen no more
A tale that truly has an idiotic ring
That's full of lotsa sound and fury
Signifying nothing..."
That's right signifying nothing
I'll repeat it! Nothing
Don't forget it - Nothing
And that's the reason for that spring 
Of joy
That the Father put inside of every
Single girl and boy
Show time! Everyone's on
Let's hit the stage
It's show time everyone an' proceed 
To act your age
Whatever you're frownin' at is funny
Enough f'laughin'
So you're wastin' all your humor on a frown
While you're bringin' your spirit down
You gotta book yourself a comic in your act
Without some laughter life's a maudlin
Farce 'n that's a fact
Once you know about the spring you always can smile
It becomes your one expression
And you're always wearin' it like the 
Buddhas do
Ponce de Leon sought this
When he was searchin' 
For the fountain of youth
I say in truth he
Sought a magical thing
For he was searchin'
For the joy spring

Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, suddenly love died
The story ended, but we're just friends
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, suddenly love died

Before you came, my time was running low

My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go
Now you're here and now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear, I found my way
For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely day
Mm, I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

Lyrics

Don't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I wouldn't leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times; I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are
Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care
I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are
I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?
I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from the heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are

Lyrics
{
Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lyrics
{
Laura is the face in the misty lights
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

And you see laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was laura but she's only a dream

And you see laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was laura but she's only a dream

Lyrics
{
Where's the love that's made to fill my heart?
Where's the one from whom I'll never part?
First they hurt me, then desert me
I'm left alone, all alone

There's no house that I can call my home
There's no place from which I'll never roam
Town or city, it's a pity
I'm left alone, all alone

Seek and find they always say
But up to now it's not that way
Maybe fate has let him pass me by
Or perhaps we'll meet before I die
Hearts will open, but until then

I'm left alone, all alone

  And | since we've no place to | go /
  Let it | snow! Let it snow! Let it | snow! |

  It doesn't show signs of | stopping /
  And I've | brought some corn for | popping |
  The lights are turned way down | low /
  Let it | snow! Let it snow! Let it | snow! /

  When we | finally kiss goodnight | //
  How I'll | hate going out in the | storm! /
  But if | you'll really hold me | tight |
  All the way home I'll be | warm |

  The fire is slowly | dying /
  And, my | dear, we're still good- | bying //
  As | long as you love me | so /
  Let it | snow! Let it snow! Let it | snow! |

I have a feeling, it's a feeling
I'm concealing, I don't know why
It's just a mental, sentimental alibi
But I adore you
So strong for you
Why go on stalling
I am falling
Our love is calling
Why be shy?
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it?
Let's close our eyes and make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try
To make a go of it
We might have an end for each other
To be or not be
Let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love
We might have an end for each other
To be or not be
Let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love
Let's fall in love
Let's fall in love
Let's fall in love

How they shock my poor brain with that electric refrain
I hear a buzzin', just like a dozen doorbells

Everytime I hear our song
I get weak in the knees my heart pumps up a breeze
Sending a stream to every extremity

Parts of my anatomy are not controlled by me
The music's magic spell
Leaves me a mess of quivering jelly

Even on a violin
Find more lyrics at ※ Mojim.com
How those sweet dulcet tones pull marrow out of my bones
I must confess, it leaves me a mess, our song

Parts of my anatomy are not controlled by me
The music's magic spell
Leaves me a mess of quivering jelly

Even on a violin
How those sweet dulcet tones pull marrow out of my bones
I must confess, it leaves me a mess, our song does
I love to hear our song cause
It grooves me so our song

Lyrics
{
My little boat is like a note
Bouncing merrily along
Hear it splashing up a song
The sails are white
The sky is bright
Heading out into the blue
With a crew of only two
Where we can share
Love's salty air
On a little paradise that's afloat
Not a care have we
In my little boat
 
The wind is still
We feel the thrill
Of a voyage heaven-bound
Though we only drift around
Warmed by the sun
Two hearts as one
Beating with enchanted bliss
Melting in each other's kiss
When daylight ends and slyly sends
 
Little stars that twinkle brightly above
It's goodbye to my little boat of love
 
Dia de luz, festa de sol
E um barquinho a deslizar
No macio azul do mar
Tudo é verão e o amor se faz
Num barquinho pelo mar
Que desliza sem parar...
Sem intenção, nossa canção
Vai saindo desse mar e o sol
Beija o barco e luz
Dias tão azuis
 
My little boat is like a note
Bouncing merrily along
Hear it splashing up a song
The sails are white
The sky is bright
Heading out into the blue
With a crew of only two
Where we can share
Love's salty air
On a little paradise that's afloat
Not a care have we
In my little boat
 
O barquinho vai

Lyrics
{
When the only sound in the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belongs to a lonesome cop
I open shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk
I go to work
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
Love that`s fresh and still unspoiled
Love that`s only slightly soiled
Love for sale
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who`s prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I know every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I`ve been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Every love but true love, love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I know every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I`ve been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Every love but true love, love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale
Oh, love for sale
Love for sale

Sky may be starless, the night may be moonless
But deep in my heart there's a glow
For deep in my heart, I know that you love me
You love me because you told me so
Love letters straight from your heart,
Keep us so near while apart,
I'm not alone in the night,
When I can have all the love you write.
I memorize every line,
I kiss the name that you sign,
And darling then I read again right from the start,
Love letters straight from your heart.
I memorize every line,
I kiss the name that you sign,
And darling then I read again right from the start,
Love letters straight from you heart.

I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissing
Oh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be
The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be
I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems
Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a kissing
Oh, what we've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be
I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

And you'll dry all my tears

Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love

Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old MacHeath, babe
And he keeps it, ah, out of sight
Ya know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, oh, wears old MacHeath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red
Now on the sidewalk, huh, huh, whoo sunny morning, un huh
Lies a body just oozin' life, eek
And someone's sneakin' ?round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?
There's a tugboat, huh, huh, down by the river dontcha know
Where a cement bag's just a'drooppin' on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town
Now d'ja hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
And now MacHeath spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done somethin' rash?
Now Jenny Diver, ho, ho, yeah, Sukey Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town
I said Jenny Diver, whoa, Sukey Tawdry
Look out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town
Look out, old Macky's back!!

Lyrics

Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous; he answers twice
It's really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee
Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring
He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee
Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, you can't confess
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee
She sits alone 'most every night
He doesn't phone her; he doesn't write
He says he's busy, but she says, "Is he?"
He's makin' whoopee
He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, "You'll pay six to her"
He says, "Now, Judge, suppose I fail?"
The judge says, "Budge right into jail"
You'd better keep her; I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee
You'd better keep her
I know it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

Are we really happy with
This lonely game we play
Looking for the right words to say
Searching but not finding
Understanding anyway
We're lost in this masquerade
Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over
But the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear
Each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason
Why we carry on this way
And we're lost in this masquerade
We tried to talk it over
But the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear
Each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason
Why we carry on this way
And we're lost in this masquerade
We're lost in a masquerade

Lyrics
{
In my loneliness,
When you're gone and I'm all by myself and I need your caress,
I just think of you,
And the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear.
Though you're far away,
I only have to close my eyes and you are back to stay.
I just close my eyes,
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone, and this heart of mine sings.
Yes, I love you so,
And that for me is all I need to know.
I will wait for you,
Till the sun falls from out the sky, for what else can I do?
I will wait for you,
Meditating how sweet life will be
When you come back to me.

Waking skies at sunrise
Every sunset too
Seems to be bringing me
Memories of you
Here and there, everywhere
Scenes that we once knew
And they all just recall
Memories of you
How I wish I could forget those
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears
Your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories of you
And your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories, just memories of you

Lyrics
{
Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice,
Warmer than the Summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.
I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.
Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!
The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.
The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun,
The midnight sun,
The midnight sun,
The midnight sun.

Lyrics
{
  Look at me, 
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.
Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.
Can't you see that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.
On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.
Too misty,
And too much
In love

Moon river wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker
Wherever you're going I'm going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbows end
Waiting round the band
My huckleberry friend, moon river
And me
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbows end
Waiting round the band

Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

Icy finger waves
Ski trails on a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, how they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...

Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, how they sing down the highway
And they travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...

Evening summer breeze
The warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

More than the greatest love
The world has known,
This is the love 
That I give to you, 
Alone.
More than the simple words
I try to say,
I only live to love you
More each day.
More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so.
My life will be in your keeping;
Waking, sleeping,
Laughing, weeping.
Longer than always
Is a long, long time.
But far beyond forever,
You'll be mine.
I know I never lived before,
And my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more.
More than the greatest love
The world has known,
This is the love
That I give to you,
Alone.
More than the simple words
I try to say,
I only live to love you
More each day.
More than you'll ever know
My arms got to hold you so.
My life will be in your keeping;
Waking, sleeping,
Laughing, weeping.
Longer than always 
Is a long, long, long time.
But far beyond forever
You'll be mine.
I know I never lived before,
And my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more.

Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need
More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know
Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know) 
Loving you the way that I do 
There's nothing I can do about it 
Loving may be all you can give 
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said "Good-bye"
More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know

Lyrics
{
The scene is set for dreaming
Love's knocking at the door
But oh my heart, I'm reluctant to start
For we've been fooled before
The night is like a lovely tune
Beware, my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care, my foolish heart
There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When you are lost in the magic of a kiss
Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware, my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start
For this time, it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love, my foolish heart
For this time, it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love, my foolish heart

Long ago my heart and mind
Got together and designed
The wonderful girl for me
Oh what a fantasy
Thought the ideal of my heart
Can't be ordered a la carte
I wonder if she will be
Always a fantasy
Will I ever find the girl in my mind?
The one who is my ideal
Maybe she's a dream and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me
Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she was my ideal
Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she is my ideal

My little boat is like a note
Bouncing merrily along
Hear it splashing up a song
The sails are white
The sky is bright
Heading out into the blue
With a crew of only two
Where we can share
Love's salty air
On a little paradise that's afloat
Not a care have we
In my little boat
 
The wind is still
We feel the thrill
Of a voyage heaven-bound
Though we only drift around
Warmed by the sun
Two hearts as one
Beating with enchanted bliss
Melting in each other's kiss
When daylight ends and slyly sends
 
Little stars that twinkle brightly above
It's goodbye to my little boat of love
 
Dia de luz, festa de sol
E um barquinho a deslizar
No macio azul do mar
Tudo é verão e o amor se faz
Num barquinho pelo mar
Que desliza sem parar...
Sem intenção, nossa canção
Vai saindo desse mar e o sol
Beija o barco e luz
Dias tão azuis

How my thoughts go flashing back again
To my old flame
My old flame
My new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent
So magnificent or elegant
As my old flame
I've met so many men
With fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who sent me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became
Of my old flame
I've met so many men
With fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who sent me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same

Lyrics

If I don't see her each day, I miss her
Gee, what a thrill each time I kiss her
Believe me, I've got a case 
On Nancy with the laughin' face
She takes the winter and she makes it summer
And summer could take a few lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughin' face
Did you ever heard mission bells ringin'?
Well, she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks you would think it was singin'
Just hear her say hello
I swear to goodness you can't resist her
Sorry for you, she has no sister
No angel could replace
Nancy with the laughin' face

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"

"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"

It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you
It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you
When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams came true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you will only grant me
The right to hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night
The nearness of you

A song happy and gay,
A song that we know
All the musitians will play.
You know, so it would seem,
Everybody loves nica's dream.

A song loaded with love.
A sweet melody Given by angels above.
You know, so it would seem,
Everybody loves nica's dream.

She had a vision
That jazz would one day be
The music that's of
The future, you see.
Don't you agree?
We'll help to see that
Her vision will come true.
And all the world will be
Blessed by it too.

This song is here to stay my friend.
Just wait and see.
The people have made
It part of jazz history.
You know, so it would seem,
Everybody loves nica's dream.

Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer show'are is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you
Night and day
You are the one
Only you 'neath the moon 
Or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
No matter, darling where you are
I think of you
Night and day
Day and night
Why it is so
That this longing for you 
Follows wherever I go
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day
Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry 
Yearnin' burnin' inside of me
And it's torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life 
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day

They say that you're a run around lover
Tho' you say it isn't so
You say that your at home when you phoned me
And how much, you really care.
Tho' you keep telling me that your lonely
I'll know if someone is there!
Cause the night, has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes, can't help but see,
If you aren't true to me!
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes.
But if you put me down for another
I'll know, believe me
I'll know
Cause the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes can't help but see
If you aren't true to me
So remember when you tell those
Little white lies that the night
Has a thousand eyes
One of these days you're gonna be sorry
Cause your game I'm gonna play
And you'll find out without really trying
Each time that my kisses stray
That the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes will see me through
And no matter what I do
I could never disguise
All those little white lies
Cause the night has a thousand eyes
So remember when you tell those
Little white lies that the night
Has a thousand eyes

The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with it's cool evening light
But shining at night, in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright
The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand
Words fail, to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each night's a deeper night
In a world, ages old
The cares of the day seem to vanish
The ending of day brings release
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
Where the nights are filled with peace
Each wonderful night in Tunisia

That certain night
The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square
I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square
The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square
How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square
Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square
The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?
Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square
That night in Berkeley square.

No more blues, I'm going back home
No, no more blues, I promise no more to roam
Home is where the heart is
The funny part is my heart's been right there all along
No more tears and no more sighs
And no more fears, I'll say no more goodbyes
If travel beckons me, I swear I'm gonna refuse
I'm gonna settle down and there'll be no more blues
Everyday while I am far away
My thoughts turn homeward, forever homeward
I've traveled 'round the world in search of happiness
But all the happiness I've found was in my hometown
No more blues, I'm going back home
No, no more dues, I'm through with all my wandering now
I'll settle down and never roam and find a man and build a home
When we settle down, there'll be no more blues
Nothing but happiness when we settle down, there'll be no more blues

I want to be no one but me
I am in love with a lady who likes me the way I am
I have my faults, she likes my faults
I'm not very bright, she's not very bright
She thinks I'm grand, that's grand for me
She may be wrong but if we get along
"What do we care?", say we
Walking on the shore, swimming in the sea
When I am with her, I am glad the boy who's with her
Is nobody else but me
She thinks I'm grand, that's grand for me
She may be wrong but if we get along
"What do we care?", say we
Walking on the shore, swimming in the sea
When I am with her, I am glad the boy who's with her
Is nobody else but me
When I am with her, I am glad the boy who's with her
Is nobody else but me

Lyrics
{
Everyone knows him as old folks
Like the seasons he comes and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so
Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And his own corn cob pipe is so mellow, hits right
But you needn't be ashamed of him
In the evenings after supper
What stories he tells
How he held his speech at Gettysburg for Lincoln that day
You know I know that one so well
One thing we don't know about old folks
Did he fight for the blue or the gray?
But he's so democratic and so diplomatic
We always let him have his way
In the evenings after supper
What stories he tells
How he held his speech at Gettysburg for Lincoln that day
Yes, I know that one so well
Some day there will be no more old folks
What a lonely old world this will be
Children's voices at play will be still fonding
The day they take old folks away

All by myself, alone
Get you and keep you in my arms evermore
Leave all your lovelies weeping on the far away shore

Out on the briny with a moon big and shiny
Melting your heart of stone
I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China

All to myself alone
Leave all your lovelies
Weeping on the far away shore

Out on the briny with a moon big and shiny
Melting your heart of stone

It's very clear our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
Oh the radio and a telephone, movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go
But oh my dear our love is here to stay
Together we're going on a long, long way
In time the rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay but our love is here to stay
It's very clear our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go
But oh my dear our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble

But oh my dear our love is here to stay

Lyrics
{
Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
Way above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Lyrics
{
Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away
Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day
And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me
Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine
And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me
And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you

  Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven
Don't ya know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
(You'll find your fortune fallin' all over town)
(Be sure that your umbrella)
Is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers
(So when you hear it thunder) Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me
?Pennies from heaven

Perdido, I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta
Bolero, he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero: 'Let's meet for a sweet fietsa'
High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
He glanced as I danced the Bolero
He smiled as he tipped his sombrero
High was the moon when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Since then has my heart been perdido
I must go to Torido, that yearning telude
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
The day the fiesta started
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
That's when my heart departed
It's perdido

Lyrics
{
A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an "Oh, beg your pardon"
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream
The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said "May I have the next one?"
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream
There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more
Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words "Ever after"
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream

Lyrics
{
If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss
If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss
Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss
Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Lyrics
{
No strings have pearls in a velvet glove
The thing I long for is the gift of love
No ring of gold but a dream to unfold

When all the stars have flown and we're alone
The gift of love is a precious thing
A touch of magic on a day in spring
The golden dream every dreamer pursues
Remember darling never refuse the gift of love
For love can be a melody that lingers
Or slip like April wine right through your fingers
So kiss me sweet till our secret star
Illuminates the way to Shangrila
Whatever fate may befall all I know
Is that the gift of love is the greatest gift of all
For love can be a melody that lingers
Or slip like April wine right through your fingers
So kiss me sweet till our secret star
Illuminates the way to Shangrila
Whatever fate may befall all I know
Is that the gift of love is the greatest gift of all
What a ball, that's all

Lyrics
{
  A little bit of me and a whole lot of you
Add a dash of starlight and a dozen roses, too
Then let it rise for a hundred years or two
And that's the recipe for making love
It doesn't need sugar 'cause it's already sweet
It doesn't need an oven 'cause it's got a lot of heat
Just add a dash of kisses to make it all complete
And that's the recipe for making love
And if you've made it right you'll know it
It's not like anything you've made before
And if you've made it wrong you'll know it
'Cause it won't keep you coming back for more
I didn't get it from my grandma's book upon the shelf
I didn't get it from a magical and culinary elf
No, a little birdie told me you can't make it by yourself
And that's the recipe for making love

It begins to tell 'round midnight
'Round midnight
I do pretty well 'til after sundown
Suppertime I'm feeling sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight
Memories always start 'round midnight
'Round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And old midnight knows it too
When some quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darling I need you
Lately I find
You're out of my arms
And I'm out of my mind
Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around
Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around

When you said you care 'magine my emoshe
I swore then and there, permanent devoshe
You made all other men seem blah
Just you alone filled me with ah
'S wonderful, 's marvelous
You should care for me
'S awful nice, 's paradise
'S what I love to see
You've made my life so glamorous
You can't blame me for feeling amorous
Oh, 's wonderful, 's marvelous
That you should care for me
'S magnifique, 's what I seek
You should care for me
'S elegant, 's what I want
'S what I love to see
My dear, it's four leaved clover time
From now on my heart's working overtime
'S exceptional, 's no bagatelle
That you should care for
That you should care for

My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all the days of the year that you live be laughing days
With all my heart, sweet happy life
And may the night times that follow the day be dancing
nights
Stars for your smile, moons for your hair
And someone's wonderful love for your loving heart to share
My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all your sorrows be gone and your heart begin to sing
And if a wish can make it be
I wish you spend everyday of your happy life with me
Stars for your smile, moons for you hair
And someone's wonderful love for your loving heart to share
My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all your sorrows be gone and your heart begin to sing
And if a wish can make it be
I wish you spend everyday of your happy life with me, sweet
happy life, sweet happy life.

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town, gather all
He's making a list and checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
The kids in girls and boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland town all around the Christmas tree
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin'
You mean, the big fat man with the long white beard
He's comin' to town

Cigarette holder which wigs me
Over her shoulder she digs me
Out cattin' that satin doll
Baby, shall we go out skippin'?
Careful, amigo, you're flippin'
Speaks Latin that satin doll
She's nobody's fool so I'm playing it cool as can be
I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no girl catching me
Swich-e-rooney
Telephone numbers well you know
Doing my rhumbas with uno
And that's my satin doll

{
A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you
It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you
You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
For you

Once I had a secret love that lived within the heart of me,
All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free.
So I asked a friendly star the way that lovers often do
Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you.
Now I shout it from the highest hill, even told the golden daffodils,
And now my heart's an open door, and my secret love's no secret any more.

Though spring is here, to me it's still September

One day we walked along the sand
One day in early spring
You held a piper in your hand
To mend its broken wing
Now I'll remember many a day
And many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper's song
The shadow of a smile
The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes
My love and see
All the lovely things
You are to me
Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

Lyrics

Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?
Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane
And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon
Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?
Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Lyrics
{
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Oh, I of course replied
Something here inside cannot be denied
They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
Oh, when your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I can not hide
Oh, so I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
Smoke gets in your eyes

Strange, dear, but true, dear,
When I’m Close to you dear,
The stars fill the sky,
So in love with you am I.

Even Without you
My arms fold about you.
You know, darling, why,
So in love with you am I.

In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care.

So taunt me and hurt me,
Deceive me, desert me,
I’m yours ‘til I die,
So in love,
So in love
So in love with you, my love, am I.

The dawn is filled with dreams
So many dreams which one is mine
One must be right for me
Which dream of all the dreams
When there's a dream for every star
And there are oh so many stars
So many stars
The wind is filled with songs
So many songs which one is mine
One must be right for me
Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars
Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles
Which one to choose, which way to go, how can I tell
How will I know, out of, oh
So many stars, so many stars
Yes, the wind is filled with songs, so many songs
Which one is mine, one must be right for me
Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are, oh, so many stars, so many stars
Yes, the wind is filled with songs, so many songs
Which one is mine, one must be right for me
Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are, oh, so many stars, so many stars
Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles
Which one to choose, which way to go, how can I tell
How will I know, out of, oh, so many stars
So many stars...so many stars... oh, so many stars

Softly as in a morning sunrise
The light of love comes stealing
Into a newborn day
Flaming with all the glow of sunrise
A burning kiss is sealing
A vow that all betray
For the passions that thrill love
And take you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love
And let it fall to hell
So ends the story
Softly as in a morning sunrise
The light that gave you glory
Will take it all away
Softly as in a morning sunrise
The light of love comes stealing
Into a newborn day
Flaming with all the glow of sunrise
A burning kiss is sealing
A vow that all betray
For the passions that thrill love
And take you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love
And let it fall to hell
So ends the story
Softly as in a morning sunrise
The light that gave you glory
Will take it all away
Softly as it fades away
Softly as it fades away
Softly as it fades away
Softly as it fades away

In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by
In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die
I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
There's no one
Could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send me back my love

Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I will find the one
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Oh, please make my dreams come true

There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb
There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although he may not be the man
Some girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me

Down deep in my heart I hear it play
I can feel it start, then it melts away
I hear music when I touch your hand
A beautiful melody from some enchanted land
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say
"Is this the day?"
I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain
Must it be forever inside of me?
Why can't I let it go? Why can´t I let you know?
Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing?
Beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet, and the words are true
The song is you
Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing?
That beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet, and the words are true
The song is you

Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized
Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone
Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
Learned everything from your books on the shelf
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself
Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone
Sophisticated lady take a lesson from me
I can help you be what you want to be
Together we'll see many brighter days
If it takes forever, gonna change your ways
Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Speak low when you speak, love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, we're swept apart, too soon
Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go that tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon
Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief
We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon

Lyrics
{
And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.

Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.
Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.
All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.
Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.

The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.
That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.
That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Strangers in the night
Exchanging glances
Wondering in the night
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through?
Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Strangers in the night, two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
And ever since that night
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right
For strangers in the night
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
Ever since that night
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right
For strangers in the night
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo
Doo-doo-dee-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah

Funny, he never asks for my money

And that he can spend anytime
I'd make a million trips to lips

Because he's sweeter than chocolate candy to me
He's confectionery

Summertime, and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush, little baby, don't you cry
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning, there ain't nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning, there ain't nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by
Summertime, and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush, little baby, don't you cry

No gal made has got a shade on sweet Georgia Brown
Two left feet but oh so neat, has sweet Georgia Brown
They all sigh and wanna die for sweet Georgia Brown
I'll tell you why, you know I don't lie... much

It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came why it's a shame how she coos 'em down
Fellers she can't get are fellers she ain't met
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her
Sweet Georgia Brown

All aboard, get on the "A" train

Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.
I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.
I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.

Tangerine, she is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine, when she dances by, senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
And I've seen toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run, but her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine
Tangerine, she is all they say
With mascara'd eye and chapeaux by Dache.
Tangerine, with her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame.
And I've seen clothes on Tangerine
Where the label says "From Macy's Mezzanine".
Yes, she's got the guys in a whirl, but she's only fooling one girl
She's only fooling Tangerine!

Picture you upon my knee, 
Just tea for two and two for tea,
Just me for you
And you for me alone.
Nobody near us
To see us or hear us,
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations.
We won't have it known, dear,
That we own a telephone, dear;
Day will break and you'll awake 
And start to bake a sugar cake, 
For me to take
For all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, 
A boy for you, a girl for me.
Oh, can't you see
How happy we would be?

Did you say that I've got a lot to learn?
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Ooh, teach me tonight
Let's start with the A-B-C of it
Getting right down to the X-Y-Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight
The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, I love you
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teachers stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Come on and teach me tonight
I'll use that star to write, I love you
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teachers stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me, please teach me tonight

The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly

Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

I can only give you love that lasts forever
And the promise to be near each time you call
And the only heart I own for you and you alone
That's all, that's all
I can only give you country walks in springtime
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And a love whose burning light
Will warm the winter night
That's all, that's all
There are those, I am sure, who have told you
They would give you the world for a toy
All I have are these arms to enfold you
And the love time can never destroy
If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you adore, for now and evermore
That's all, that's all
There are those, I am sure, who have told you
They would give you the world for a toy
All I have are these arms to enfold you
And the love time can never destroy
If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you adore, for now and evermore
That's all, that's all

No sweeter song, no heart so true
There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me
You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone
There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love

This is our last dance together
Tonight soon will be long ago
And in our moment of parting
This is all I want you to know
There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing
Another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you
There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me
Like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never, ever be another you?
Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never, ever be
Another you?

Lyrics
{
Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain
A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you
First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The "Ile de France" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you
Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

There are many many crazy things
That will keep me loving you
And with your permission
May I list a few
The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no they can't take that away from me
We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of
The way you hold your knife
The way we danced until three
The way you changed my life
No, no they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

Are we really happy with
This lonely game we play
Looking for the right words to say
Searching but not finding
Understanding anyway
We're lost in this masquerade
Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over
But the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear
Each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason
Why we carry on this way
And we're lost in this masquerade
We tried to talk it over
But the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear
Each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason
Why we carry on this way
And we're lost in this masquerade
We're lost in a masquerade

Too young to go steady
Too young, I hear her say
She says we're not ready
But then why am I feeling this way?
Too young, so she tells me
She says we'll have to wait
Why wait till it may be too late?
Can she realize she drives me wild?
Is she made of stone?
Must she always act just like a child?
Won't she ever own up, we're grown up?
Someday she'll be sorry
Someday just wait and see
She'll wish she'd gone steady with me
Can she realize she drives me wild?
Is she made of stone?
Must she always act just like a child?
Won't she ever own up, we're grown up?
Someday she'll be sorry
Someday just wait and see
She'll wish she'd gone steady with me

The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream, I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem to me that's everything
The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you, the very thought of you, my love
The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you, the very thought of you, my love

Lyrics
{
In her own sweet world
Populated by dolls and clowns
And a prince and a big purple bear
Lives my favorite girl,
Unaware of the worried frowns
That we weary grown ups all wear
In the sun she dances to silent music,
Songs that are spun of gold
Somewhere in her own little head
One day all too soon
She'll grow up and she'll leave her dolls
And her prince and her silly old bear
When she goes they will cry
As she whispers "Good-bye."
They will miss her I fear
But then so will I

Let someone start believing in you,
Let him hold out his hand
Let him touch you and watch what happens
One someone who can look in your eyes,
And see into your heart
Let him find you and watch what happens
Cold, no i won't believe your heart is cold
Maybe just afraid to be broken again
Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you,
And what magic you'll see
Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you.
And what magic you'll see
Let someone give his heart,
Someone who cares like me
Let someone give his heart who cares like me

Vou te contar, os olhos já não podem ver
Coisas que só o coração pode entender
Fundamental é mesmo o amor
É impossível ser feliz sozinho
O resto é mar, e tudo que eu não sei contar
São coisas lindas que eu tenho pra te dar
Vem de mansinho a brisa e me diz
É impossível ser feliz sozinho
Da primeira vez era a cidade
Da segunda o cais e a eternidade
Agora eu já sei, da onda que se ergueu no mar
E das estrelas que esquecemos de contar
O amor se deixa surpreender
Enquanto a noite vem nos envolver
Da primeira vez era a cidade
Da segunda o cais e a eternidade
Agora eu já sei, da onda que se ergueu no mar
E das estrelas que esquecemos de contar
O amor se deixa surpreender
Enquanto a noite vem nos envolver

No tears, no fears
Remember there's always tomorrow
So what if we have to part
We'll be together again
Your kiss, your smile
Are memories I'll treasure forever
So try thinking with your heart
We'll be together again
Times when I know you'll be lonesome
Times when I know you'll be sad
Don't let temptation surround you
Don't let the blues make you bad
Someday, someway
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not good bye
We'll be together again
Times when I know you'll be lonesome
And times when I know you'll be sad
But don't let temptation surround you
Don't let the blues make you bad
Someday, someway
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not good bye
We'll be together again

What's new?
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Lovely as ever I must admit
Oh, what's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee, but it's nice to see you again
What's new? Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand
I understand, adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed: I still love you so
Oh, what's new? Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand
Mama, I understand, adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed: I still love you so

{
When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

Lyrics
{
Sing low, sing clear.
Sweet words, in my ear.
Not a whisper of despair, but loves own prayer.
Sing on, until, you bring back the thrill...
of a sentimental tune, that died to soon.
A harmony was lost, but you forgave i forgot.
whisper not a quarrels past.
You know we've had our last, so now, we'll be on key
constantly, love will whisper on eternally.
Not a whisper of despair, but sweet tender loves own prayer.
own prayer...
Oh the sentimental tune that died long ago.
too soon, too soon.
Why did we listen when they said it wouldn't last?
Gossiping voices made us break up .
but you know we could make up if we forget them all.
and answer cupids call...
Whispers of trouble are an echo of the past.
all it will take to lose my gloom is just a whisper not a
rumor of your love for me.
and thats how its got to be.
So now, we be on key constantly.
Love will whisper on eternally...
Sing low, sing clear, sweet words in my ear.
Love will whisper on, eternally...

Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me
My heart wants to know
And so I must go
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
And after the day
That darkness will hide me
And maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
They're still borrow
My share of laughter
With you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away
With you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away

Yes, Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Listen willow and weep for me

Yes, Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Oh, Whisper to the wind and say that love's a sin
Leave my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing, crying all alone

Oh, willow weep tree
Weeping sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, bend over willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love is sin
Leave my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone

Yes, willow weep tree
Weeping sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, bend over willow and weep for me
Yes

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, Are you married?
We'll say, No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down
When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

  / Those fingers | in my hair |

  / That strips my | conscience bare |
  It's witchcraft | |

  / And I've got | no defense for it |
  / The heat is | too intense for it |
  / What good would | common sense for it | do? | // 'Cause it's | 

  witchcraft | // Wicked | witchcraft | // And although |
  I know | // it's strictly | taboo | |

  / When you arouse | the need in me |
  / My heart says | yes indeed in me |
  / Proceed with what | you're leading me | to | |

  / It's such an | ancient pitch |
  / But one I | wouldn't switch |
  / 'Cause there's no | nicer witch than | you |

Lyrics
{
Though I know that we meet every night
And we couldn't have change since the last time,
To my joy and delight,
It's a new kind of love at first sight.
Though it's you and it's I all the time
Every meeting's marvelous pastime.
You're increasingly sweet,
So whenever we happened to met
I greet you
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and
At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.
Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
And these stars will not twinkle and fade out,
And the words in my ears
Will resound for the rest of my years.
In the morning I find with delight
Not a note of our music is played out.
It will be just as sweet,
And an air that I'll live to repeat:
I greet you
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and
At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.

You and the night and the music
Fill me with flaming desire
Setting my being completely on fire
You and the night and the music
Thrill me, but will we be one
After the night and the music are done?
Until the pale light of dawn and in daylight
Hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning will come without warning and take away the stars
If we must live for the moment
Love till the moment is through
After the night and the music die
Will I have you?
Until the pale light of dawn and in daylight
Hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning will come without warning and take away the stars
If we must live for the moment
Love till the moment is through
After the night and the music die
Will I have you?

Lyrics
{
You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too
You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with
Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs
If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty
Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs
If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty
